    "## spaCy Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "**spaCy** (https://spacy.io/) is an open-source Python library that parses and \"understands\" large volumes of text. Separate models are available that cater to specific languages (English, French, German, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installation and Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Installation is a two-step process. First, install spaCy using either conda or pip. Next, download the specific model you want, based on language.<br> For more info visit https://spacy.io/usage/\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. From the command line or terminal:\n",
    "> `conda install -c conda-forge spacy`\n",
    "> <br>*or*<br>\n",
    "> `pip install -U spacy`\n",
    "\n",
    "> #### Alternatively you can create a virtual environment:\n",
    "> `conda create -n spacyenv python=3 spacy=2`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Next, also from the command line (you must run this as admin or use sudo):\n",
    "\n",
    "> `python -m spacy download en`\n",
    "\n",
    "> #### If successful, you should see a message like:\n",

    "## Parts of pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tokenizer\n",
    "The first step in processing text is to split up all the component parts (words & punctuation) into \"tokens\". These tokens are annotated inside the Doc object to contain descriptive information. We'll go into much more detail on tokenization in an upcoming lecture. For now, let's look at another example:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS)\n",
    "The next step after splitting the text up into tokens is to assign parts of speech. Here some statistical modeling is required. For example, words that follow \"the\" are typically nouns.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a full list of POS Tags visit https://spacy.io/api/annotation#pos-tagging\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependencies\n",
    "We also looked at the syntactic dependencies assigned to each token. `Tesla` is identified as an `nsubj` or the ***nominal subject*** of the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a full list of Syntactic Dependencies visit https://spacy.io/api/annotation#dependency-parsing\n",
    "<br>A good explanation of typed dependencies can be found [here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/dependencies_manual.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Token Attributes\n",
    "We'll see these again in upcoming lectures. For now we just want to illustrate some of the other information that spaCy assigns to tokens:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "|Tag|Description|doc2[0].tag|\n",
    "|:------|:------:|:------|\n",
    "|`.text`|The original word text<!-- .element: style=\"text-align:left;\" -->|`Tesla`|\n",
    "|`.lemma_`|The base form of the word|`tesla`|\n",
    "|`.pos_`|The simple part-of-speech tag|`PROPN`/`proper noun`|\n",
    "|`.tag_`|The detailed part-of-speech tag|`NNP`/`noun, proper singular`|\n",
    "|`.shape_`|The word shape â€“ capitalization, punctuation, digits|`Xxxxx`|\n",
    "|`.is_alpha`|Is the token an alpha character?|`True`|\n",
    "|`.is_stop`|Is the token part of a stop list, i.e. the most common words of the language?|`False`|\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spans\n",
    "Large Doc objects can be hard to work with at times. A **span** is a slice of Doc object in the form `Doc[start:stop]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sentences\n",
    "Certain tokens inside a Doc object may also receive a \"start of sentence\" tag. While this doesn't immediately build a list of sentences, these tags enable the generation of sentence segments through `Doc.sents`. Later we'll write our own segmentation rules."
