      "The blog post titled \"DeepSeek vs. OpenAI – New Race in AI,\" published on January 29, 2024, discusses the author's journey exploring AI technologies, specifically comparing OpenAI's models with DeepSeek, an emerging open-source LLM from China.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Points:\n",
      "- The author highlights their experience using OpenAI's frontier models for various tasks and their curiosity about DeepSeek after its recent launch.\n",
      "- **DeepSeek** raises concerns regarding **data security**, requiring users to log in and share personal information, which parallels worries about how user data might be handled, especially in light of the recent TikTok ban in the US.\n",
      "- **UI/UX Issues**: The author encountered significant navigation problems on DeepSeek’s website, questioning its stability and user-friendliness compared to OpenAI.\n",
      "- **Political Sensitivity**: DeepSeek avoids addressing sensitive political topics, raising doubts about the trustworthiness of its outputs.\n",
      "- The author concludes that while DeepSeek shows promise, they prefer to continue using OpenAI for now, with plans to further explore DeepSeek's capabilities through practical applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the blog reflects a cautious yet curious exploration of emerging AI technologies and the importance of user security and experience in technology adoption.\n"
