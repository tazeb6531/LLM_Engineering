    "### spaCy Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "**spaCy** (https://spacy.io/) is an open-source Python library that ***parses*** and ***understands*** large volumes of text. Separate models are available that cater to specific languages (English, French, German, etc.). It uses a pipeline-based architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "**It Provides a pretrained models for tasks:**\n",
    "* Tokenizer – Splits text into tokens.\n",
    "* Tagger – Assigns part-of-speech (POS) tags.\n",
    "* Parser – Analyzes grammatical structure (dependency parsing).\n",
    "* Named Entity Recognizer (NER) – Identifies entities like names, dates, and locations.\n",
    "* Lemmatizer – Converts words to their base form (e.g., running → run).\n",
    "* Text Classifier (if included) – Categorizes text into predefined labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installation and Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Installation is a two-step process. First, install spaCy using either conda or pip. Next, download the specific model you want, based on language.<br> For more info visit https://spacy.io/usage/\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. From the command line or terminal:\n",
    "> `conda install -c conda-forge spacy`\n",
    "> <br>*or*<br>\n",
    "> `pip install -U spacy`\n",
    "\n",
    "> #### Alternatively you can create a virtual environment:\n",
    "> `conda create -n spacyenv python=3 spacy=2`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Next, also from the command line (you must run this as admin or use sudo):\n",
    "\n",
    "> `python -m spacy download en`\n",
    "\n",
    "> #### If successful, you should see a message like:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **`Linking successful`**<br>\n",
    "> `    C:\\Anaconda3\\envs\\spacyenv\\lib\\site-packages\\en_core_web_sm -->`<br>\n",
    "> `    C:\\Anaconda3\\envs\\spacyenv\\lib\\site-packages\\spacy\\data\\en`<br>\n",
    "> ` `<br>\n",
    "> `    You can now load the model via spacy.load('en')`"

    "### Scenario: Automating Resume Screening for Job Applications\n",
    "A company receives thousands of resumes and wants to automate the initial screening process using **spaCy**. The ***NLP pipeline*** can help extract useful information from candidate resumes and categorize them based on job relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Each Component is Used:\n",
    "* **Tokenizer** – Splits the resume text into individual words/tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example: “Experienced Python developer with 5 years of experience” → [\"Experienced\", \"Python\", \"developer\", \"with\", \"5\", \"years\", \"of\", \"experience\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tagger (POS tagging) –** Identifies parts of speech to understand key terms.\n",
    "    Example: \"Python\" (NOUN), \"developing\" (VERB), \"experienced\" (ADJ).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Parser (Dependency Parsing)** – Analyzes the grammatical structure to understand relationships between words.\n",
    "    Example: Identifies that “5 years” modifies “experience,” meaning the candidate has 5 years of experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Named Entity Recognizer (NER)** – Extracts key entities like names, locations, skills, and dates.\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    John Doe (PERSON)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Python, Machine Learning (SKILLS)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Microsoft (ORG)\n",
    "\n",
    "    New York (GPE – Geo-Political Entity)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lemmatizer –** Converts words into their root form for better matching.\n",
    "    Example: \"Developing\" → \"Develop\", \"Worked\" → \"Work\".\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Text Classifier –** Categorizes resumes into predefined job roles based on keywords and extracted information.\n",
    "    Example: If the resume contains \"Python, TensorFlow, Machine Learning,\" it is classified under \"Data Scientist\"; if it includes \"Java, Spring Boot,\" it is classified under \"Backend Developer\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Outcome:\n",
    "The company can automatically filter and rank resumes based on skills, experience, and job relevance, saving HR teams hours of manual screening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like a code example for implementing this scenario in spaCy? 🚀"

While it's possible to solve some problems starting from only the raw characters, it's usually better to use linguistic knowledge to add useful information.

    "In **spaCy**, **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** is a process that identifies and classifies entities in text, such as names, organizations, dates, and locations. The **`ner`** component in spaCy’s pipeline is responsible for detecting these entities based on pre-trained models.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 🔍 **1️⃣ Lemmatization**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lemmatization** reduces a word to its **base or dictionary form (lemma)** based on its **meaning and context**. It requires a vocabulary and **morphological analysis** of the word.  \n",
    "- **Tool in spaCy:** `token.lemma_`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "- `running` → `run`  \n",
    "- `better` → `good`  \n",
    "- `studies` → `study`  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics:**  \n",
    "- **Context-aware** (depends on POS tags)  \n",
    "- **Slower but more accurate**  \n",
    "- Requires a language model (e.g., `en_core_web_sm` in spaCy)  \n",
